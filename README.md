# KooM

## Abstract

In this unprecedented time, families are facing challenges as schools are transitioning into a remote learning setting. One of such challenges is the safety of childrens using video conferencing platforms. Many parents worry about their children getting exposed to things that are considered harmful such as cyberbullying or unhealthy comments. With Koom, we aimed to provide a platform that parents can monitor their children by notifying any uncultured behavior that their child is experiencing.
